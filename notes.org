* Initial Notes
- avoid tweaking hyper parameters until we have a car going around the track
- minimize you action space based on track to save on tracking time
  * e.g. if your race is clockwise your car might not need to ever consider turning left
- race format seems to encourage over fitting
- first test race is ace speedway
- start with additive reward function rather than multiplicative
- have default reward value that is only lost for egregious actions
- entropy pattern is reset when model is cloned so expect different behavior
- add reward on lap completion
- seems worth using on the spot for training and jupyter notebook for log analysis
